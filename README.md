# GovTech

I have named the questions according to the section.

I did not attempt section 5 because I have no experience/yet to learn  machine learning. 
Section 2 is some SQL queries in a py file because I faced issue when using the Postgres docker image. I have tried to do a workaround using mySQL and the codes are attached therein.

Thank you.
